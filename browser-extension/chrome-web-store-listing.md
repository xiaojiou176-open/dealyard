# Dealwatcher Chrome Companion Listing Notes

Use this file when you submit the repo-owned Chrome companion package to the Chrome Web Store.

## Suggested title

`Dealwatcher Companion`

## Short description

`Open Dealwatcher Compare from the current grocery product page and keep the local-first workflow one click away.`

## Full description

Dealwatcher Companion is the browser helper for the local-first Dealwatcher runtime.

It helps you take the current grocery product page and open Dealwatcher's compare-first workflow without pretending the extension itself is the product runtime.

What it does:

- opens the local Dealwatcher `#compare` route
- pre-fills the current tab URL into the compare form
- provides a context-menu shortcut for the same action
- lets you configure the local Dealwatcher base URL

What it does not do:

- it does not run compare logic inside the extension
- it does not replace the Dealwatcher API / worker / WebUI runtime
- it does not expose write-side automation
- it does not claim hosted SaaS behavior

## Single-purpose statement

This extension exists to hand the current product page into the local Dealwatcher compare flow faster.

## Permission explanations

- `activeTab`: read the current tab URL when you ask the extension to open Dealwatcher Compare
- `tabs`: open the Dealwatcher local runtime in a new tab
- `storage`: remember the local Dealwatcher base URL
- `contextMenus`: offer a right-click "Open in Dealwatcher Compare" shortcut
